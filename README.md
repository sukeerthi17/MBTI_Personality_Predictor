This project is a personality prediction system that identifies a user's MBTI type based on their responses to a structured quiz. It uses a Random Forest model trained on labeled questionnaire data and delivers results via an interactive Streamlit web interface. Users receive both a logic-based and AI-predicted personality type, with matching descriptions, quotes, and images for better personalization and understanding.
